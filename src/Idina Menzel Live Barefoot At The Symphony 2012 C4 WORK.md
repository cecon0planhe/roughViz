Menzel performed a mix of Broadway hits, pop songs, and original tunes, showcasing her powerful vocals and charismatic personality. She sang classics like "Funny Girl", "Don't Rain on My Parade", "Where or When", and "Tomorrow", as well as contemporary songs like "Poker Face", "Love for Sale/Roxanne", and "No Day But Today". She also dueted with her husband, actor Taye Diggs, on a romantic medley of "I'm Not That Girl" and "As Long As You're Mine" from *Wicked*.
 
One of the highlights of the show was Menzel's rendition of "Defying Gravity", the anthem from *Wicked* that made her a Broadway superstar. She also sang "For Good", another song from *Wicked*, dedicated to her friend and co-star Kristin Chenoweth. Menzel shared stories and jokes with the audience, revealing her humor and warmth. She also paid tribute to Hamlisch, who passed away shortly after the concert, calling him "Marvin's long lost brother".

She also sang "I'm Not That Girl", a song she co-wrote with Glen Ballard for the musical adaptation of *The Other Woman*.
 
The concert was filmed by director Ron de Moraes, who captured Menzel's energy and charisma on stage, as well as the intimate moments with the audience and the orchestra. The show was broadcast on PBS as part of their Great Performances series, and was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Special Class Programs.
